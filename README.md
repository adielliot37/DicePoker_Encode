# DicePoker_Encode
DicePoker game involves 2 contracts 1 for Random Number generation for Dice using QRNG and other one is game contract in which user can join and play the game . I havent merged both the contracts because re-Deploying QRNG contract is quite complicated since everytime I have to set request parameter which invloves generating sponsor wallet everytime
